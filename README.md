# Shopify-Link-Builder
A simple shopify ATC link builder based in the discord API.

Setup:
Create a discord developer application and get a valid token. A tutorial can be found here: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/

Once you have replaced the TOKEN variable you should be able to simply invite the bot to your server and start running it.

Commands:
Use !build <link> with the link to a shopify product and it will return ATC links.
